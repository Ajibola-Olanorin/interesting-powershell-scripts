# List-UnusedFiles
## The script will help you find list of old unused files and folders

It is very easy to use.


## Installation / Setup

- Clone the repo in your design code editor (I used PowerShell ISE for this)
- Insert the path to the folder in the empty "" string of $DirTree
- Highlight all the codes and press F5
- Result will display in your console pane
- (Tip) Press ctrl + c to abort the process


> If the code doesn't work for you 
> keep calm and try again.
> Check your path and try again :)

**Enjoy!!!**
